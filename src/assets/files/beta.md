# Atom BETA Group

Given the versatility of the Atom there are a great number of use cases to test across; Gear Mode, Ergo Mode, Workouts, Just Ride, Climbs, Zwift, Zwift Workouts, TrainerRoad, The Sufferfest... and combinations of them all. Here is where you can really get involved and help us make your experience better.

Every release we produce is heavily tested. Automated scripts, mechanical testing rigs, and human testers are all involved and often quality feedback on quick iterations is the biggest time factor to launching new features, bug fixes and enhancements.

We're committed to continual improvement, marginal (and not-so marginal) gains, and consistently enhancing our products for new and existing customers and so the requirement for quality testing is not going away any time soon. Your support will really help us keep up the pace and move in a direction that supports you.

### How it works

We will initially be using Apple's TestFlight for beta testing, so the tests will be limited to those using iOS devices. Of course for a firmware update you can use the iOS BETA app to update your Atom and then use your normal Android device for riding if you want to.

Do sign up if you are an Android user as we will shortly be rolling out a similar system for Android testing.

### What we test
There are a number of things we may want to test with a particular release.

- Content enhancements such as tests or specialist workouts
- Firmware updates which won't impact the app but make a huge difference to the ride experience
- App features such as ride screens or navigation

### Stability
By the time we push a change to the BETA group it will have had some testing internally, we are mainly looking for UX feedback rather than bugs for example, so hopefully most bugs will have been ironed out. But there are times we want to know what direction to go in so will post a BETA version early to get a feel for what works best for our customers. We will do our best to let you know what to expect with each release but sometimes blind testing is what we are looking for.

### What happens to my ride data
Your data will be saved as normal to your Hub account and any third party you use
