<h1>Wattbike Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>25th May 2018</strong></p>
<p>Wattbike Limited is committed to preserving the privacy of all visitors to <a href="http://wattbike.com">wattbike.com</a>, users of Wattbike mobile or desktop apps and users of any other Wattbike online, digital and offline services. Collectively, “Service(s)”
  or “Wattbike Service(s)”.</p>
<p>Please read the following Privacy Policy to understand how we store, use and protect the information that you provide to us.</p>
<h2>Wattbike Data Protection Officer</h2>
<p>We have a dedicated data protection officer (“DPO”). You can contact the DPO in writing at the address below or by emailing <a href="mailto:dpo@wattbike.com">dpo@wattbike.com</a></p>
<p>Data Protection Officer<br> Wattbike Ltd<br> Unit 16, Nottingham South and Wilford Ind Est<br> Ruddington Lane<br> Nottingham

<h2>Information sources</h2>
<p>For the most part the information Wattbike collects or processes will come directly from you, either provided over the phone to a Wattbike representative, in writing, or entered manually online or via an app. In some cases we may receive information you
  grant us access to when linking with a third party service, or if you use a third party service (Facebook/Twitter) to log into a Wattbike Service.</p>
<h2>What information do we collect and process</h2>
<p>The information we collect or process will depend on how you interact with Wattbike and which Services you make use of. Placing an order will require a different set of data than creating an account on our app for example.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We collect the basic information required to create an account on our Services, in most cases this is limited to an email address and password, but may also include details such as a reference code from a social platform if one was used to log into
    or create an account.</li>
  <li>If placing an order, we will require the information relevant to processing and fulfilling the order. We use industry standard encryption when processing this data and do not store payment details or process payments ourselves. Information processed
    will include, amongst others, billing and delivery address, contact phone and email address, payment card details, product details, and for finance orders some historical, employment and other personal information required by our finance partner.
    We strive to process or collect the minimum information required to fulfil these orders.</li>
  <li>You can optionally choose to add basic profile information on some Wattbike Services, such as first and last name, country of residence and upload an image to compliment your profile.</li>
  <li>For full use of the Wattbike Hub apps there is additional information that is required. Gender, weight and DOB for example are all required for much of the Wattbike Hub functionality to work as you would expect.</li>
  <li>Wattbike will collect a minimal amount of data from third parties when this will improve your experience using Wattbike Services. For example if you connect to Apple Health or Google Fit we will collect your current weight value these services store
    so we can provide the best experience when using the Wattbike Hub. You can restrict this access at any time.</li>
  <li>Wattbike may collect biometric data from third party hardware such as heart rate belts and watches, but only if you explicitly choose to connect these.</li>
  <li>Optionally when using Wattbike Services we will record location data to help us understand our users and improve our products and services</li>
  <li>We may combine information that we collect from you with information obtained from other members, third parties and information derived from any other subscription, product, or service we provide.</li>
  <li>We collect information from your browser, computer, or mobile device, which provide us with technical information when you access or use Wattbike Services. This technical information includes device and network information, cookies, log files and analytics
    information.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Why do we collect, store, process or share information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As necessary to provide Wattbike Services and fulfil our obligations. For example, we will require address and contact details to fulfil an order and we will need to pass payment details to a payment provider to process a card payment.</li>
  <li>Where necessary to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
  <li>Where you have made the information public.</li>
  <li>Where necessary for the purposes of Wattbike’s or a third party’s legitimate interests.</li>
  <li>Where you have explicitly chosen. For example if you link with Strava we will send them your activity data when you upload a session.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where do we store data</h2>
<p>Wattbike Service’s databases and processing resources are located on servers based in Europe; primarily in the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>Wattbike cannot guarantee the physical location of information stored or processed by third party services used by Wattbike, or any services you choose to connect and share information with.</p>
<h2>What information do we process</h2>
<p>There are a few situations where we will process information but not store it, or only store part of it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When we process a finance application Wattbike will only store the information required to fulfil the order. The financial and personal information required to process the finance application is securely encrypted and forwarded to our finance partner,
    V12 Finance, for processing and is not stored by Wattbike. For V-12’s Privacy Policy please visit our Finance Page.</li>
  <li>When processing a card payment Wattbike will not store details of the payment card, but we will store billing address and contact details.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When and how do we share your data</h2>
<h3>Publicly</h3>
<ul>
  <li>By default, activity information uploaded to the Wattbike Hub service - such as the power and cadence produced during a Wattbike session - is publicly available.</li>
  <li>No required personal information, e.g. email, is made publicly available</li>
  <li>You can choose to make your account private at any time which will cause future sessions to be private by default. You can also set historical and individual sessions to be private from your account on <a href="http://hub.wattbike.com">hub.wattbike.com</a></li>
